Answer the following logic puzzle question by carefully analyzing constraints and reasoning between <cot_start> and <cot_end>. Then on a new line, write your final answer choice (A, B, C, etc.).

Example 1:
Question: If George can present only on Tuesday, and Olivia canâ€™t present in the afternoon, who can present on Wednesday morning?
Choices: A) George  B) Helen  C) Irving  D) Olivia  E) Kyle
<cot_start>
George can only present on Tuesday, so not on Wednesday.
Olivia cannot present in the afternoon, but this is morning, so she is eligible.
Still, other rules suggest Helen is more likely.
<cot_end>
Answer: B

Example 2:
