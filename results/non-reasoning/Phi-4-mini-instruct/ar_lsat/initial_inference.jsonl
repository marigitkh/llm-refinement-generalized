This violates the \"at least as many French novels as Russian novels\" requirement. Thus, (A) is not possible.\n\nB) Exactly one French novel is selected.\n- With only one French novel selected, we can select up to three French plays (since \"no more than four French works\" is satisfied). This leaves room to select two Russian novels and one Russian play to meet the requirement of \"at least three but no more than four novels.\" All constraints are satisfied. Thus, (B) is possible.\n\nC) All three plays are selected.\n- If all three plays are selected, then there are no other novels or plays left to select. This violates the requirement of \"at least three but no more than four novels.\" Thus, (C) is not possible.\n\nD) All three Russian novels are selected.\n- Selecting all three Russian novels means only one French novel can be selected (to satisfy the \"no more than four French works\").

No more than four French works can be selected. This means the organizer can select 1, 2, 3, or 4 French works.\n\n2. At least three but no more than four novels must be selected. Novels are the French novels and Russian novels. This means the organizer can select 3 or 4 novels in total.\n\n3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. This means if a Russian novel is selected, at least one French novel must be selected.\n\n4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. This means both French plays cannot be selected together with the Russian play.\n\n5. At least five works must be selected, but no more than six.\n\nConsidering these constraints, let's analyze the choices:\n\nA) Select one French novel and one French play satisfies the requirement of French works but does not meet the requirement of novels (only one novel is selected). It also does not satisfy the condition of selecting at least three novels.\n\nB) Select one French novel and one Russian play satisfies the requirements of French works, novels, and Russian works but does not satisfy the"}
