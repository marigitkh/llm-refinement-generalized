Identify the number of red apples: There are 7 red apples.\n2. Identify the number of green apples: There are 2 green apples.\n3. Add the number of red apples and green apples to find the total number of apples in the basket.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ (red apples)} + 2 \\text{ (green apples)} = 9 \\text{ (total apples)} \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\text{Answer: A } 9 \\]\n\n### Explanation\n\nIn this problem, we are dealing with simple addition. We need to combine the two types of apples (red and green) to find the total number of apples in the basket. This involves adding the quantity of of one type of apple to the quantity of of another type of apple.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n\\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 9 apples in the basket..\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic principle of addition, which is a fundamental arithmetic operation that forms the basis for more complex mathematical concepts."}
