How many balloons did Allan and Jake have in the park?\nPlease state your reasoning and clearly end with: Answer: <letter> <number>\nTo solve this problem, we need to add the number of balloons Allan brought to the number of balloons Jake brought.\n\n1. Identify the numbers to be added:\n   - Allan brought 2 balloons.\n   - Jake brought 4 balloons.\n\n2. Add the numbers:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. State the answer:\n   Allan and Jake have 6 balloons in the park.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Understand the problem:\n   - Allan brought 2 balloons.\n   - Jake brought 4 balloons.\n   - We need to find the total number of balloons they have together.\n\n2. Set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of balloons} = \\text{Number of balloons Allan brought} + \\text{Number of balloons Jake brought}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of balloons} = 2 + 4\n   \\]\n\n3. Perform the addition:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. State the answer:\n   Allan and Jake have 6 balloons in the park.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: A 6"}

More plums were added to the basket. Now there are 21 plums. How many plums were added to the basket?\nPlease state your reasoning and clearly end with: Answer: <letter> plums\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many plums were added to the basket. We know that initially there were 17 plums in the basket and after adding more plums, the total number of plums is 21..\n\nLet's denote the number of plums added as \\(x\\). The problem can be written as:\n\n\\[ 17 + x = 21 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\(x\\), we need to solve the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 21 - 17 \\]\n\\[ x = 14 \\]\n\nSo, the number of plums added to the basket is \\(14\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{4}\\) plums."}
