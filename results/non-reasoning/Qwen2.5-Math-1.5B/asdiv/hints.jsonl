Identify the number of red apples: There are 7 red apples.\n2. Identify the number of green apples: There are 2 green apples.\n3. Add the number of red apples and green apples to find the total number of apples in the basket.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\\[ 7 \\text{ (red apples)} + 2 \\text{ (green apples)} = 9 \\text{ (total apples)} \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\text{Answer: A } 9 \\]\n\n### Explanation\n\nIn this problem, we are dealing with simple addition. We need to combine the two types of apples (red and green) to find the total number of apples in the basket. This involves adding the quantity of of one type of apple to the quantity of of another type of apple.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n\\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 9 apples in the basket..\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic principle of addition, which is a fundamental arithmetic operation that forms the basis for more complex mathematical concepts.", "hint_sentence": "A basket contains 7 red apples and 2 green apples.

How many balloons did Allan and Jake have in the park?\nPlease state your reasoning and clearly end with: Answer: <letter> balloons. The solution involves basic arithmetic operations: addition and subtraction. We start by adding the number of balloons brought by Allan and Jake, then subtracting the number of balloons they might have given away or lost.\n\n1. Add the number of balloons Allan and Jake brought to the park:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 = 6\n   \\]\n   Therefore, Allan and Jake initially had 6 balloons in the park.\n\n2. Since there were no specific details about any balloons being given away or lost in the problem statement, we assume that all the balloons were there initially.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\nReasoning:\n- We sum the initial number of balloons brought by Allan and Jake.\n- The result is the total number of balloons present in the park initially.\n\nBy following these steps, we used fundamental arithmetic operations to solve the problem clearly and logically.", "hint_sentence": "To answer the original question correctly, we need to know the number of balloons each person brought to the park and then add them together.
