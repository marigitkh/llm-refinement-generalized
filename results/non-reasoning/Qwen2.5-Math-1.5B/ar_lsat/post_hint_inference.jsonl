The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected.

If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play cannot be selected. This leaves us with the task of selecting at least five and at most six works, with no more than four French works, at least three but no more than four novels, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels.\n\nOption A) one French novel and one French play: This is not possible because if the French play is selected, the Russian play cannot be selected, violating the constraint that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.\n\nOption B) one French novel and one Russian play: This is a valid selection. If we select one French novel and one Russian play, we can then select two French plays, making a total of three French works, which is within the limit of of four French works. We can also select one Russian novel, making a total of two novels, which is within the limit of at least three but no more than four novels. This selection also complies with the constraint that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.\n\nOption C) one Russian novel and one French play:"}
