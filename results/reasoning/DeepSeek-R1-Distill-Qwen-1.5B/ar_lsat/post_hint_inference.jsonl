So, George must give a report on Tuesday.\n2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. That means on both Tuesday and Wednesday, the afternoon slot is reserved for someone who can't be in the morning. Wait, but Tuesday is already taken by George, so on Tuesday, the morning slot must be someone else, and the afternoon slot is also reserved for someone who can't present in the morning. So, on Tuesday, neither Olivia nor Robert can present in the afternoon. But since Tuesday is George's day, he must present in the morning on Tuesday. That leaves the afternoon slot on Tuesday for"}
