So, George is out of the pool for Monday and Wednesday.\n2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

So, they can only present in the morning on their respective days, but their afternoon slot is restricted.\n3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports.

The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected.

Let's break down the given information:\n\n1. **Total Works**: The organizer will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The works are categorized as:\n   - 3 French novels\n   - 3 Russian novels\n   - 2 French plays\n   - 1 Russian play\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - **French Works**: No more than four French works can be selected.\n   - **Novel Works**: At least three but no more than four novels are selected.\n   - **French vs. Russian Novels**: At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.\n   - **French Plays vs. Russian Plays**: If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's analyze the possible selections:\n\n- **French Plays**: We can select 0, 1, or 2 French plays. If we select both, we must exclude the Russian play.\n- **Novel Works**: We need to select between 3 and 4 novels. Since French works are limited, it's more likely we'll select"}
