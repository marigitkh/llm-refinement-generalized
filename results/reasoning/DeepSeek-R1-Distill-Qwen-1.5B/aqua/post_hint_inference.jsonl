Importantly, these black marbles were returned to the bag after being pulled out.\n\nThe key insight is that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is the same as the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time. This implies that the proportion of black marbles in the bag remains unchanged.\n\nSince no black marbles were added to the bag during the second draw, the total number of black marbles in the bag remains zero. Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 0%. Consequently, the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time (also 0%) remains consistent.\n\nGiven this, the total number of marbles in the bag is simply the number of white marbles, as there were no black marbles added or removed.
