However, since we're seeking the maximum number of students outside both groups, we can calculate it as follows:\n\n- **Total Attendance**: The minimum of the two attendance constraints is 90 students.\n- **Students Outside Attendance**: Subtracting the total attendance from the total student body gives the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debate.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum Outside Attendance} = 200 - 90 = 110\n\\]\n\n**Answer: E)**"}
